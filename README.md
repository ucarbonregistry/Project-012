Lamdeng Waste to Energy Project, Manipur
The Lamdeng Waste to Energy Project, Manipur is located at Village: Lamdeng, District: Imphal
West, State: Manipur, India. The waste processing facility (project activity) treats 120 tonnes of
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) waste per day. In the absence of the project activity, the MSW from
Imphal would be dumped in Porompat and Langol open landfill sites.

Construction of the waste processing facility at Lamdeng was completed in November 2014 and
operated for trial period for three months (which was in February 2015) and the plant was nonfunctional after this trial period of three months in 2015. Afterwards, the overall handling and
operationalisation of the facility was entrusted to the Planning and Development Authority of
Manipur. Further, the possession of the facilities for operation, maintenance and upgradation of the
plant was handed over to the project proponent (PP) IEC TSL Private Limited, in December 2016
in PPP mode by executing a tripartite concession agreement between the parties. The actual
operational start date is December 2016 for this project activity.

The project activity avoids the emission of methane from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and
supplies renewable electricity to the grid through utilization of this MSW fuel which would
otherwise have been left to decay anaerobically. Hence the project activity avoids CH4 and CO2
emissions and is beneficial to the environment and community. This project activity is included in
the UCR Positive List of Project Types with Environmental Additionality.

The project activity involves the processing of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) into Residue Derived
Fuel (RDF). The RDF is used to generate electricity (600 KWh) which is being supplied to the grid
that is maintained by the Manipur State Power Company Ltd. (MSPCL), which acts as a deemed
transmission licensee for the State of Manipur to undertake the function of transmission of
electricity and also discharge all functions of the State Transmission Utility (STU). Between 2017
and April 2021, the MSW was treated by mechanical treatment to produce refuse-derived fuel
(RDF)/stabilized biomass (SB). This RDF was transported outside the project boundary and
supplied as renewable fuel to replace fossil fuel at various industries, however, no carbon credits are
being claimed for this activity outside the project boundary. From April 2021 onwards, the RDF is
used for generating renewable power and supplied to the local grid.

There is no negative environmental and social impact for this project activity. By avoidance of
methane and utilizing MSW for generation of electricity, the project results in reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions that are real, measurable and give long-term benefits to the mitigation of
climate change.
